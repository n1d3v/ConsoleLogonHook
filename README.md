## Installation
> [!WARNING]

1. Copy the 2 DLL files (ConsoleLogonHook.dll and ConsoleLogonUI.dll) from [Releases](https://github.com/wiktorwiktor12/ConsoleLogonHook/releases) into %SYSTEMROOT%\System32

~~2. Take `authui.dll` from Windows 7 SP1, rename it to `au7hui.dll` and place it into %SYSTEMROOT%\System32, Or alternatively, just copy au7hui.dll from releases. This is required, as ConsoleLogonHook will push resources from it to use in the logon screen.~~ No longer necessary as of v1.0.6

~~3. Take ownership of `ConsoleLogon.dll` and replace it with the version from [Releases](https://github.com/wiktorwiktor12/ConsoleLogonHook/releases), this a temporary solution until a pdb offset finder system is added in.~~ **No longer necessary as of v1.0.3**

2. Open a CMD window as TrustedInstaller via PsExec64 and copy and paste the following commands:

```cmd
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsRuntime\ActivatableClassId\Windows.Internal.UI.Logon.Controller.ConsoleBlockedShutdownResolver /v DllPath /t REG_SZ /d %systemroot%\System32\ConsoleLogonHook.dll /f

reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsRuntime\ActivatableClassId\Windows.Internal.UI.Logon.Controller.ConsoleLockScreen /v DllPath /t REG_SZ /d %systemroot%\System32\ConsoleLogonHook.dll /f

reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsRuntime\ActivatableClassId\Windows.Internal.UI.Logon.Controller.ConsoleLogonUX /v DllPath /t REG_SZ /d %systemroot%\System32\ConsoleLogonHook.dll /f

reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsRuntime\ActivatableClassId\Windows.Internal.Shell.PlatformExtensions.ConsoleCredUX /v DllPath /t REG_SZ /d %systemroot%\System32\ConsoleLogonHook.dll /f
```
or merge the regkey in the release zip as trusted installer.


3. Take ownership of the file `Windows.UI.Logon.dll` and rename it to something else. Example: `Windows.UI.Logon.dll.bak`, this is required as it will force the use of the console logon screen.
